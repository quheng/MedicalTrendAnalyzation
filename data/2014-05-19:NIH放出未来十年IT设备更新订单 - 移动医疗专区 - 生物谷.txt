2014年5月18日讯 /生物谷BIOON/ --美国国家健康中心（NIH）最新宣布，其此前签订的一系列IT设备更新协议已经到期，目前正在寻求与合适的公司和组织签订新一期的供货合约。这一合约的时间长达十年，其涉及资金数额更是估计将达到200亿美元之多。根据这一协议，NIH将透过美国联邦政府以协议签订的价格在未来十年内向合约另一方购买电脑以及一系列IT设备。与以往不同，此次移动设备也在合约采购目录之中。其中苹果公司的iPhone5以及黑莓公司的Q10都在考虑范围之内。NIH的有关负责人表示，有意参与这一合约的公司需要在6月11日之前向NIH提交意向书。（生物谷Bioon.com）详细英文报道：With the U.S. National Institutes of Health's (NIH) current IT procurement contract ending in November, the agency has laid out its successor: a 10-year contract for laptops, servers and other equipment and services worth up to $20 billion.Nextgov reported on the contract, which NIH posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website. The contract covers IT needs across the federal government, but NIH and its parent--the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)--are the primary focus. Setting up the procurement deal--known as a government-wide acquisition contract--will allow NIH to buy certain products for preagreed prices instead of seeking competitive bids for each order.NIH is looking to negotiate prices for a range of commonly used IT items, such as laptops with Intel i5 processors for its basic users and more powerful or rugged versions for staff with specialized requirements. While the list of laptops just details the specifications NIH wants, the agency singles out individual models of mobile phones it plans to procure. Apple's ($AAPL) iPhone 5 and BlackBerry's ($BBRY) Q10 are the agency's phones of choice.Specialized healthcare equipment and systems are also part of the contract, with NIH looking to strike deals with suppliers of natural language processing tools and medical monitors. The contract is capped at $20 billion, but it is unclear how much NIH will actually spend over the course of the 10-year period. Companies interested in supplying NIH with equipment have until June 11 to respond to its proposal.
